### Variables

- Variables are containers for storing data (storing data values).
- In this example, `x` & `y` variables are defined using `let` keyword.  

```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = 'Josh';
```

- You can also use `var` keyword to declare a variable

```javascript
var x = 5;
var y = 'Josh';
```

### Challenges:

- **Favorite Number**: Use a variable to represent your favorite number. Then, using that variable, create a message that reveals your favorite number. Print that message.

- What is the difference between `const` and `let`?

- **Classic Calculator**: Given `x` = 10, `y` = 5. Write a short program to print addition, subtraction, multiplication, division & modulus operations on `x` and `y` respectively.

- **Perimeter of a Rectangle**: You are given a rectangle of `width` = 10m and `width` = 20m. Calculate its perimeter and store the answer in variable `result`. Output, "The perimeter is: $result"
